            <h2>Entering the public sphere of the internet</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Relaunching personal website: </strong> What you see here is the first version I've had of my personal website since the early 2000s or so.  Ever since joining the professional world, 
                        I've shut this down and have been a private person.  I'm looking to change this, build up an online community, and share my thoughts, ideas, and 
                        help others solve their problems.   I'm looking to build a community of like-minded people who want to help each other out.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Getting active on social media: </strong> I've mostly abandoned Facebook for a few years now.  I am focusing on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram.  I'm looking to build up a following on these platforms, 
                        primarily <a href="https://twitter.com/dalew" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>. I'm looking to build up a following of like-minded people
                        who want to help each other out. I want to start engaging in more conversations to expose me to new people and ideas, as well as build an audience for those who would 
                        like to take advantage of my services and apps I plan to launch.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>

            <h2>Dev Projects</h2>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Multiple Personality Bot: </strong> Making a Discord and telegram bot that can impersonate any famous celebrity/figure, past or present
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Personal assistant app: </strong> The idea is I want one console-like app that can do everything I need.  Anytime I get an idea, note something 
                    I need to buy, or want to remember something, I want to be able to do it in one place.  I want to be able to ask it questions, and have it either just 
                    record the data in the appropriate place or database, or potentially take action on it.  Some things it's doing already:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Recording ideas to an ideas database</li>
                        <li>Recording groceries to buy, chores to do, and filing them appropriately</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Spotify Companion: </strong> App/website that can improve on the base functionality.  Some goals are controls to instantly hate the song playing now, and ensure 
                    it will never be played again, getting a better discovery mode that can both explore certain genres and making sure to only play music you have 
                    not heard before.
                </li>
                <li><strong>TLDR Bot: </strong> Another Discord and Telegram bot that can summarize what you've missed in a channel since you've been gone.  It uses OpenAI API to take the 
                    conversation, break it into smaller pieces (within the token limit), summarize each of those pieces, and then make a full summary of all those 
                    summaries.  It's a work in progress, but it's getting better.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>AI Art</h2>

            <p>
                I spent a couple months last summer using <a href="https://www.midjourney.com" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">Midjourney</a> to create art and images. I had since let my
                subscription lapse, but I've recently signed up
                again. I'll be posting daily creations at my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dalew75/" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>. I used a free version
                called <a href="https://www.bluewillow.ai/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueWillow</a>, but that model was
                not as good as the Midjourney version, so back to paying the $24+ a month.

            <h2>Sports</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Baseball: </strong> I'm entering my 6th year playing <a href="https://www.lowellotb.org/index.php?league=otb" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Over Thirty Baseball (OTB)</a>.  I used to be a good player way back in Little League, 
                    playing 3rd and 1st base, but I decided to quit baseball back after that.  More recently I learned about adult baseball leagues in the area. 
                    In 2018, I joined the <a href="https://www.lowellotb.org/otbTeamInfo.php?teamid=44&season=2023&league=otb" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Indians</a>.  The following year I also joined the <a href="https://www.lowellotb.org/index.php?league=notb" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Night Over Thirty Baseball</a> league (NOTB), joining the <a href="https://www.lowellotb.org/otbTeamInfo.php?teamid=115&season=2023&league=notb" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Mariners</a>.  
                    We lost in the semis that first year, and then went on to win the championship the following 3 years!  
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Volleyball: </strong> It was nice finally returning to the indoor coed leagues this winter in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/142738989510563/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Littleton Volleyball League</a> (LVL) and 
                    the Billerica Volleyball League (BVL).  There was a 3 year hiatus on those leagues due to COVID.  Now my wife and I just opened the sand court at 
                    our house, which we built in 2008, and more recently put lights in in 2019.   
                </li>
                <li><strong>Tennis: </strong> Last spring, I played a lot of singles in the <a href="https://www.tennisnortheast.com/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Tennis Northeast League</a> (TNE), but started getting some hip flexor issues.  
                    I didn't play again until my winter doubles group Sunday mornings at <a href="https://trullbrook.com/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Trull Brook Country Club</a>.  They are threatening to shut down that facility in 
                    favor of using the building for an indoor golf training center, but they haven't yet started working on it, I think due to the economy.  It looks 
                    like we get to play again next season as of now too.  I will probably join TNE again sometime this summer when and if I get a little more time.
